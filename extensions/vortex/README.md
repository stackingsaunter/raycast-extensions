# Vortex

The fastest way to use bitcoin on macOS.

Vortex lets you control a Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC) lightning wallet directly from Raycast.

## Setup

1. When you first use Vortex, you'll be prompted to paste your NWC connection secret (`nostr+walletconnect://...`).
2. Choose your preferred fiat currency.
3. You can edit your NWC connection string later by going to `Extensions` → `Vortex` → `Preferences`.

## Compatible wallets (NWC)

Vortex works with any NWC-enabled wallet. Examples:

- [Alby Hub](https://getalby.com/)
- [Cashu.me](https://wallet.cashu.me/)
- [Coinos](https://coinos.io/)
- [LNbits](https://lnbits.com/)
- [Primal Wallet](https://primal.net/)
- [Blitz](https://blitz-wallet.com/)

See the full list of NWC wallets in the [awesome-nwc repository](https://github.com/getAlby/awesome-nwc).

Umbrel and Start9 users can also use Vortex with NWC wallets available in their app stores (for example, Alby Hub or LNbits).
